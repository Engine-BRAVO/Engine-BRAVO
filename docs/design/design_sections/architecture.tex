\subsection{GameObjects Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GameObjects} are the main objects in the engine. They can contain multiple components, and are the objects which are updated every cycle.
    \item \textbf{Components} are the parts of the GameObjects. They can be added and removed from GameObjects, and are updated every cycle
\end{itemize}
ECS is not used because the decision was made that there is too little time to create a ECS system that is efficient enough to warrant the extra work it would cost to implement it.
Instead of ECS, a more standard Object Oriented approach is used.

\subsection{Scenes Architecture}
Scenes are the "levels" that can be created in the engine. Each scene contains a vector of zero or more GameObjects pointers.
A scene also contains one or ore Camera objects.
The SceneManager is responsible for creating, loading and unloading scenes and is described in more detial in the Scene Manager chapter.
