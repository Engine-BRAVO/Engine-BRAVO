\section{Components}
\label{sec:components}
Just like in Unity, the components are the building blocks of the game objects.
They are the individual features that can be added to a game object to give it functionality.

\subsection{AudioSource}
See \autoref{sec:audio} for more information.
Used to add audio to a GameObject.

\subsection{Collider}
Has \texttt{bodyID}, which is needed for the physics.

\subsection{NetworkObject}
see \autoref{sec:networking} for more information.

\subsection{Sprite}
Used to add a still image to a GameObject.
See \autoref{sec:rendersystem} for more information.

\subsection{Animation}
Used to add an animated image to a GameObject.
See \autoref{sec:rendersystem} for more information.

\subsection{Collider}
 Colliders can be applied to game components to give provide the object with collision detection
See \autoref{sec:physics} for more information.
\subsection{CircleCollider}
Specific circle shape for the colluder
\subsection{BoxCollider}
Specific box shape for the collider

\subsection{RigidBody}
A rigidbody is a physical body in the Box2D world. It contains collision handling and physics interaction between other Rigidbodies or static objects.
See \autoref{sec:physics} for more information.

\subsection{IBehaviourScript}
IBehaviour script is an interface that can be used to create behaviour scripts for GameObjects.
The copy constructor copies the variable which checks if onStart is already called. 
With this when a prefab is defined the on start will be called for the new object.
If an already initialized object is copied, the onStart will not be called again.

\subsection{ParticleEmitter}
Particle emitter is a component that can be used to create particle effects.
See \autoref{sec:particlesystem} for more information.

\subsection{AudioSource}
Used to add audio to a GameObject. See chapter \autoref{sec:audio} for details

\subsection{Transform}
The Transfrom is not a class but a struct. It represents the position, rotation and scale of a GameObject.
Does not need an update flag when the position is changed, as a movable object is usually moving.
