\section{Components}
\label{sec:components}
Just like in Unity, the components are the building blocks of the game objects.
They are the individual features that can be added to a game object to give it functionality.

\subsection{AudioSourceProxy}
See \autoref{sec:audio} for more information.
Used to add audio to a GameObject.

\subsection{ParticleEmitterProxy}
See \textbf{TODO: add reference to particle emitter}
Used to create particle effects.

\subsection{AnimationProxy}
See \textbf{TODO: add reference to Animation emitter}

\subsection{SpriteProxy}
See \textbf{TODO: add reference to Sprite emitter}

\subsection{Collider}
Has \texttt{bodyID}, which is needed for the physics.

\subsection{NetworkObjectProxy}
see \autoref{sec:networking} for more information.

\subsection{Sprite}
Used to add a still image to a GameObject.
See \autoref{sec:rendersystem} for more information.

\subsection{Animation}
Used to add an animated image to a GameObject.
See \autoref{sec:rendersystem} for more information.

\subsection{Collider}

\subsection{CircleCollider}

\subsection{BoxCollider}

\subsection{RigidBody}
Has \texttt{bodyID}, which is needed for the physics.

\subsection{IBehaviourScript}
IBehaviour script is an interface that can be used to create behaviour scripts for GameObjects.

\subsection{ParticleEmitter}
Particle emitter is a component that can be used to create particle effects.
See \autoref{sec:particlesystem} for more information.

\subsection{AudioSource}
Used to add audio to a GameObject. See chapter \autoref{sec:audio} for details

\subsection{Transform}
The Transfrom is not a class but a struct. It represents the position, rotation and scale of a GameObject.
Does not need an update flag when the position is changed, as a movable object is usually moving.
