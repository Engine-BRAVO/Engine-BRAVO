GameObjects are the basic building blocks of the game.
A GameObject is just a container for components, which have a shared position.
The GameObject class has functions like hasComponent, addComponent, getComponents, and removeComponent, for registered components manipulation.
Everything that is visible in the game is a component which is attached to a GameObject.
All GameObjects are stored in scenes, which are the different levels of the game.
A GameObject always possesses a Transform, because it is necessary to have a position in the game world.
Components can be added to the GameObjects at runtime, from the Behaviourscripts.
% GameObjects can contain multiple animtors and multiple sprites, if any of them are active they will be rendered.
UIObjects are a special type of GameObjects that are used for the User Interface.
More information about the UIObjects can be found in the UI section.
