GameObjects are the main objects in the engine. They are part of a Scene and contain zero or more components.
The transform struct is always a part of the the GameObjects, so the GameObjects always have a position, rotation and scale.
The components are can be added to GameObjects are described in the Components chapter.
Components can be added to the GameObjects at runtime.
GameObjects can contain multiple animtors and multiple sprites, if any of them are active they will be rendered.
UIObjects can also be created, which inherit from GameObjects. UIObjects are described in more detail in the UI chapter.
