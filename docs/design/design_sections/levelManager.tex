\section{Scene Manager}
\label{sec:sceneManager}
The \texttt{sceneManager} (state machine responsible for transitioning between scenes) is never automatically updated, it is only updated when called by a behaviour script.

\noindent The scene manager is responsible for creating, loading and unloading scenes.
Scenes are kept in the level as a vector of unique pointers to the scene.
This is done to keep the memory management of the scenes in one place and ensure memory leaks are avoided through the use of unique pointers.
The SceneManager can also use the TileMap class to create a scene from a tilemap, which is described in more detail in \autoref{sec:tilemaps}.
The scene manager also keep track of which scene is currently active.
