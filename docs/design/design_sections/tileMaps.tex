\section{Tilemaps}
\label{sec:tilemaps}
Tilemaps are a way to make a level made of small, resuable tiles and thus create a 2D level in an easy way.
Tilemaps will be parsed in the engine using the Tilemaps class.

The map creator that is used to create the tilemaps for the engine is Tiled.
Tiled is a free, open-source third party map editor that can be used to create 2D maps.
The reason Tiled is chosen is primarily because it was recommended for this project.
Another advantage Tiled has is its extensive documentation and its ease of use.
Maps created in Tiled are exported in a .tmx format, which is a type of XML file.
The engine will parse the map file using a library called Tmxlite, which is recommended in the Tiled documentation.
Required textures can be loaded using the TextureManager.
From the parsed map, the SceneManager will create a scene and add GameObjects with a sprite component.
