\section{Tilemaps}
Tilemaps can be used to create levels more easily.
Tilemaps will be parsed in the engine.
\\
The map creator that is used to create the tilemaps is Tiled.
The reason Tiled is chosen is primarily because it was recommended for this project.
Another advantage Tiled has is its extensive documentation and its ease of use.
\\
Maps created in Tiled are exported in a .tmx format, which is a type of XML file.
The engine will parse the map file using a library called Tmxlite, which was recommended in the Tiled documentation.
Required textures can be loaded using the TextureManager.
From the parsed map, the engine will create a scene and add GameObjects with a sprite component.
