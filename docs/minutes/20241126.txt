Notes class 26 November
Group Crepe:
- Engine is largely finished, only incidental small changes remain
- Do not have a very concrete planning
- Tests: have a few unit tests, for the managers and utilities. Used to avoid writing subs, because systems are proven to work
- Integration tests: for verifying ECS system and its dependencies
- No code coverage tests, because of potentially misleading results.
- Similarly to us, validation app is purely for demonstrating that the customers' requirements are met.
- No static code checks

Group Alpha:
- Very slightly behind schedule, but not significantly
- Use GitHub for keeping track of finished tasks


Question Bob:
AI: There has to be 'something related to AI' present in-engine
- Definitely recommends making a graph available for usage in shortest path

Multiplayer: is customer happy with current multiplayer implementation?
'Ja. Is prima.'
