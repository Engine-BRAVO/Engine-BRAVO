Today: showing off design patterns and algorithms.

Note for Siem: mention that I am not presented during class next monday.

Design patterns:
1.  Engine is singleton, various systems have private constructors, but are not publicly accessible. (Angel)
2.  Facade for audio (Siem)
3.  Update queue (Siem)
4.  Fixed update physics. (Angel)
5.  Camera system. (Seger)
6.  Prefab + clone (Seger)
7.  Tilemap functionality (Ronan)

Algorithms:
1.  A* pathfinding (Ronan)
