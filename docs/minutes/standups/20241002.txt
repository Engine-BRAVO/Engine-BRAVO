Minutes 02-10-24

What was discussed:
Question for Bob: Does Bob want an event system / is it required.
ECS conclusions: large advantage is that it is much quicker. This applies mostly to large / complex games. There is an added risks, because if ECS is poorly implemented, it actually slows down a game.
Discuss with Bob if it is worth it to use ECS?
Ask Bob how he expects us to record minimum hardware requirements for the engine, when the engine is not made yet.
Seger: Worked on event system for inputs
Next week we'll start making a draft for the architecture


For class tomorrow:
We'll announce that we expect to need 30 minutes for our questions
- Showing POCs
    - Multiplayer (Sean)
    - Spritesheet animation (Seger)
    - Audio (Siem)
    - (If there's time) savegame (Siem)
    - (Maybe): Showing rendered map (Ronan)
    - (Maybe): Physics simulation (Angel)
- Discussing problems we expect to run into
    - Getting multiplayer to work smoothly (and online)
    - Getting all individual components to cooperate when creating an architecture / global design
    - Determining the minimum hardware requirements, even though we've no idea how the engine is going to work

What has been done:
- Siem: Audio SDLMixer PoC
- Angel: Box2D Physics POC. Cube can now move 'realisticallly' in a 2d environment. Ran into issues with animating / simulating rotation.
- Ronan: Researching ECS and extensions. GameObject has been modified to use ECS.
- Sean: State machine: created two PoCs: one example running and one self-written state machine. Have looked at navigation: we will not need recast navigation: it is too large for the scope of this project.
- Seger: Figuring input and event system

What is going to be done:
- Siem: Behavioral tree PoC instead of Sean?
- Angel: Continue physics PoC. Look into adding rotation and simulating multiple object.
- Ronan: Expanding levels PoC (tile2d), checking if a selfmade level can be rendered.
- Sean: Continue pathfinding research, A*.
- Seger: Implement the input system and the class diagram
