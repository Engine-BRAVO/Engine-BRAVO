What was discussed:
usage of gmock for unit testing all parts of the engine. Creating a DoD for minimum code coverage of unit tests. Conclusion: all code which is merged to development should have at least 80% test coverage.
How the validation app will be hosted: on a git repo, which uses the engine as a submodule.
Persistent game objects (which exist across multiple scenes): scene manager keeps track of a list of game object references, which should persist across scenes.

What has been done:
- Angel: Physics implementation
- Ronan: tilemap parser implementation
- Seger: Various rendering features, removed sdl event manager because we have a proprietary one
- Sean: improving build system / cmake, to be more convenient and sturdy. Worked on multiplayer to automatically load on program start.
- Siem: worked on savegame improvements and unit tests


What is going to be done:
- Angel: Work on physics implementation.
- Ronan: tilemap implementation adding features
- Seger: work on UI systems, help Ronan with tilemap
- Sean: Look at issues with cmake tests. Look into how clients can find servers on the network.
- Siem: work audio design updates and implementation. Add testing decision to PoA, make gcov for code coverage available.

Roadblocks:
- Angel: -
- Ronan: Finding out a good way to implement spawn points and colliders in tile2d
- Seger: -
- Sean: Clients finding all servers on a network, which is not desirable
- Siem: integrating SDL mixer with the existing SDL usage.
