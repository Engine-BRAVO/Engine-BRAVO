% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code
\usepackage{booktabs} % For better looking tables
\usepackage{geometry} % To adjust margins
\usepackage{tabularx} % For tables that auto-adjust to the page width

\title{Plan of Attack} % Sets article title
\author{Sean Groenenboom \and Seger Sars \and Siem Vermeulen \and Angel Villanueva \and Ronan Vlak} % Sets authors name
\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled
\newpage

% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
\maketitle % creates title using information in preamble (title, author, date)

    \item Headers in the research document do not contain questions
    \item No choices are made in the research document
    \item latex is used as default text editor. This is used so git can be used as version conrol.
    \item plantuml is used for UML diagrams. This is used so git can be used as version conrol.
\end{itemize}
