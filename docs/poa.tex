    \subsection{Problem analysis}
    CodedFun Games is a company that wants to scale its business, therefore
    the owner wants a custom-made game engine which can be maintained and expanded by a developer working 1 day a week.
    The engine is looking for a custom game engine that is easily maintainable, extendable and user-friendly, while also being well documented.
    The client has previous experience with Unity and wants the game engine to function and be accessible in a similar structure and API.
    \newline \newline
    Besides the game engine the client needs a simple validation game, so the client can test every feature and see how they are meant to be used.

    \subsection{Goal}
    The objective of this project is to create a game engine that the client can use for creating games at his company.
    The engine is designed to satisfy all requirements as stated in the requirements document enabling the client to make games with a custom engine without learning an entirely new game engine structure.

    \subsection{Scope}
    The game engine will be made to function on computers running a Linux operating system, because every developer uses a Linux operating system.
    \newline\newline
    The following is a list of items which will not be focused on while working on this project:  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Graphical user interface for making a game.
        \item Direct compatibility with scripts from other game engines
        \item Advanced AI systems 
        \item Cross-platform compatibility
        \item High-End Graphics features
        \item In-Depth animation systems
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Result}
    The result of this project is a user-friendly game engine that follows the API structure of the Unity game engine. 
    The engine is easily understood, maintained and extendable by an engine engineer working one day a week.
    \newline\newline
    Besides the game engine a simple validation game is created to show all the functions of the engine.

    \section{Communication}
    Communication between team members is done using whatsapp.
    \\
    Communication between the team and the Bob van der Putten 
    will be done using email, Teams or in person during the scheduled project meetings.
    \\\\
    Collaboration with code and documents is done using GitHub.
    When a team member wants to merge code, the code is reviewed by at least one other team member.
    \\\\
    Every wednesday at 9:15 the team is getting together to do a standup-meeting
     and work on the project.
    \\\\
    The team is working with a yellow and red card system.
    A yellow card means a warning. If two yellow cards are received by a teammember,
    they will be disqualified from participating in the project.
    The team is unable to issue a yellow card directly, but a recommendation to issue a card
     will be given to Bob van der Putten.
    \\
    A recommendation for a yellow card can only be issued when the following procedures have been followed:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A teammember is underperforming. This is the case when these conditions are met:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A teammember has worked fewer hours than expected on the project.
            \item The quality of the submitted work is too low.
            \item A teammember has not communicated about issues they are facing within the project on time.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The team will make an arrangement with the underperforming teammember about the work that should be submitted.
              An email about this arrangement will also be sent to Bob van der Putten
        \item After one week, the arrangement is not met by the underperforming teammember.
    \end{enumerate}
    In case these procedures have all taken place, a recommendation for a yellow card will be given.

    \section{Quality}
    Vermeld overal bij welke tools worden gebruikt (en waarom)
    \subsection{Documentation}
    The following points will be applied to ensure the documentationâ€™s quality:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All documents are written in English.
        \item All documents are written in the present perfect
        \item All diagrams are in the UML style.
        \item Headers in the research document do not contain questions
        \item No choices are made in the research document
    \end{itemize}
    Wordt markdown gebruikt voor alle documenten (heeft goede compatibiliteit met version control)? Of zijn er betere alternatieven?
    \subsection{Technical}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Code is written in english.
        \item Code is written in c++23.
        \item Doxygen is used for code documentation, except for the setters and getters
        \item Codestandard is written in ./codestandard.tex.
        \item Text editor of choice can be used.
        \item Cmake is used to build the code.
        \item Clangformat is used for code formatting.
        \item cpp check is used for code checking.
        \item valgrind is used for memory leak checking.
        \item gtest testing framework is used for testing.
        \item Unit test are written for every function except for setters without validation and getters.
        \item Third party libraries must be discussed with the whole team.
        \item One person must check git commits before merging.
        \item Only code which can be compiled may be commited to git.
    \end{itemize}

    Wat is het beleid voor versiemanagement? (welke tool(s), hoe / wanneer worden branches gemaakt, PRs reviewen etc.)
    Hoe wordt er getest? Unit tests, integratietest etc. Test framework voor gebruiken? Statische code check?
    \subsection{tools}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Git is used for version management.
        \item Github is used to store the git repo.
        \item latex is used as default text editor. This is used so git can be used as version conrol.
        \item plantuml is used for UML diagrams. This is used so git can be used as version conrol.
