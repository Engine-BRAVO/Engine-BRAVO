% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code
\usepackage{booktabs} % For better looking tables
\usepackage{geometry} % To adjust margins
\usepackage{tabularx} % For tables that auto-adjust to the page width
\usepackage{longtable} % For tables across multiple pages

\title{Requirements} % Sets article title
\author{Sean Groenenboom \and Seger Sars \and Siem Vermeulen \and Angel Villanueva \and Ronan Vlak} % Sets authors name
\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled
\newpage

% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
\maketitle % creates title using information in preamble (title, author, date)
\newpage
