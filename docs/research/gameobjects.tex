\section{GameObjects(Ronan)}

\subsection{GameObjects in a game engine}
GameObjects are the fundamental entities that represent characters, props, lights, enemies and scenery.
GameObjects are essentially containers for components, which implement the GameObject's functionality.
\\\\
\noindent A few examples of components a GameObject might have are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transform component:}
          A component handling the position, rotation and scale of a GameObject.
    \item \textbf{Render component:}
          A component to display a GameObject.
    \item \textbf{Physics component:}
          A component to add physics to a GameObject, for example velocity and mass.
    \item \textbf{Script component:}
          A component to define the behaviour of a GameObject.
    \item \textbf{Collider component:}
          A component to detect and respond to collisions with the GameObject.
\end{itemize}

\noindent GameObjects are always part of a scene and can interact with each other through the added components.

\subsection{Adding components to game objects}
A GameObject is just an empty vessel that needs components to be attached to it.
