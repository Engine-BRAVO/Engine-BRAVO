\section{particles}

Jeff Lander coins the term "Fuzzy" as a way of describing a type of object which lacks well-defined surfaces such as smoke or fire. \cite{Lander_1998} These objects contain a set of characteristics which makes it difficult to model as an object due to its random and chaotic nature. To solve this problem game engines make use of particle systems to generate particles/objects in a chaotic and controlled environment to recreate these effects.

\subsection{What is a particle system}

Compared to regular objects, Particle systems create objects which undergo a complete lifecycle. Within the life cycle, particles are created, change direction or properties, and dissappear again. Through the use of parameters controlling properties such as direction and duration a particle can appear random and natural while still following a set of determined rules to follow.
