\section{Save data}
Game data such as which level, inventory contents, character progression et cetera is most commonly stored in separate files, and commonly in standardized file types such as json or xml.
It is also possible to define a self-made syntax and structure for save files. This would come with various benefits such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better suited for the specific needs of the project
    \item It may be faster to read and/or write to because of this better match
    \item File size can be reduced because redundant information can be avoided
\end{itemize}
However, a very major drawback is the extra amount of time it requires to develop a self-made savefile.
When using an existing file format, libraries can be used to write and parse the file data \cite{stackUser35344} \cite{LazyFoo}.
